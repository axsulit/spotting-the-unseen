# THS-ST2: Spotting the Unseen

This repository contains the implementation and related files for the project "Spotting the Unseen." The primary objective of this project is to analyze and evaluate face forgery detection models under various conditions. The project is divided into several tasks, each with its own dedicated folder.

## Repository Structure

- **`task1_data_acquisition_preprocessing/`**  
  Scripts and files for acquiring datasets and preprocessing them.

- **`task2_dataset_alteration/`**  
  Scripts for altering datasets by reducing resolution and adding forgery artifacts.

- **`task3_baseline_model_training_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating baseline models on unaltered datasets.

- **`task4a_reduced_resolution_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating models on datasets with reduced resolution.

- **`task4b_blurry_image_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating models on datasets with blurry images.

- **`task4c_color_mismatch_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating models on datasets with color mismatches.

- **`task4d_spliced_boundary_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating models on datasets with spliced boundaries.

- **`task4e_added_noise_evaluation/`**  
  Scripts for training and evaluating models on datasets with added noise.
